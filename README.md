Compatibility for the [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) module to work with the [http2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http2) module

## What is this?

The awesome [http2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http2) nodejs module (https://github.com/molnarg/node-http2) does not work straight out the box with the awesome [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) module (https://github.com/expressjs/express).

Due to express having the request and response objects [[Prototype]] the inbuilt nodejs http  IncomingMessage and ServerResponse objects, all requests served by express that are initialised by something else, such as http2, cause an error.

This issue is mentioned in many places:
https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/2364 ,
https://github.com/molnarg/node-http2/issues/220 ,
https://github.com/molnarg/node-http2/issues/100 

This module creates new express request and response objects, then sets their [[Prototype]] to http2 IncomingMessage and ServerResponse objects.
The middleware returned by this module simply checks if the connection is http2 and sets the request and response [[Prototype]] to the newly created ones which have the http2 [[Prototype]].

Sadly, setting [[Prototype]] effects performance<sup>[[1]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto)[[2]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/setPrototypeOf)</sup>, which not much can be done about until a better fix/workaround is thought of, or until express changes the way their request and response objects are handled.

## Why use this?

At the moment, if someone wants to create an express application that has HTTP/2, while also serving HTTP/1.x, the closest thing you can use is the [spdy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spdy) module which works well with [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express).

With this module, you can use HTTP/2 via the [http2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http2) module with [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express).

## News:
Nodejs's experimental http2 is now available in Node v8.4.0+ under the flag "--expose-http2". See https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/14239

**This module does not support the new implementation**. Hopefully express adds support.

**This module also does not work on NodeJS versions above v8.4.0 due to the native http2 module.**

## Installation

Install the module via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-http2-workaround)
```
npm install express-http2-workaround --save
```
Or [download the latest release](https://github.com/Jashepp/express-http2-workaround/releases), or git clone the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Jashepp/express-http2-workaround).


### How to use

**Important:** When using the http2 module within NodeJS, use a path that resolves directly to the installed module, so it doesn't auto-resolve to the NodeJS internal http2 module. [Issue #3](https://github.com/Jashepp/express-http2-workaround/issues/3#issuecomment-572307723)
```javascript
var http2 = require('./node_modules/http2'); // Important: require the http2 module instead of NodeJS's internal http2 module
```

When this workaround is required, a function is available to call with an object as the argument that must contain the express module and the http2 module. If you want the express middleware to be automatically attached to the express application, simply pass the application as 'app' (see Method 1 below).

Method 1: (recommended for the average use-case)
```javascript
require('express-http2-workaround')({ express:express, http2:http2, app:expressApp });
```

Method 2:
```javascript
var expressHTTP2Workaround = require('express-http2-workaround');
expressApp.use(expressHTTP2Workaround({ express:express, http2:http2 }));
```

Method 3:
```javascript
var expressHTTP2WorkaroundMiddleware = require('express-http2-workaround')({ express:express, http2:http2 });
expressApp.use(expressHTTP2WorkaroundMiddleware);
// If you want to access an internal method, or overwrite a method for the module, see the advanced use in the readme
```

It is best to have this middleware added to your express application before any other middleware. Otherwise the known express+http2 issue may occur in previous middlewares for HTTP/2 requests.

This must be done for all sub express applications too.
```javascript
// let 'expressApp' be an existing express application
var expressHTTP2WorkaroundMiddleware = require('express-http2-workaround')({ express:express, http2:http2 }); // Create Middleware
expressApp.use(expressHTTP2WorkaroundMiddleware); // Set middleware on main express app
var subApp = express(); // create new sub express app
subApp.use(expressHTTP2WorkaroundMiddleware); // Set middleware on sub express app
expressApp.use(subApp); // Add the sub express app to the main/parent express app
```

## Example

```javascript
// Require Modules
var fs = require('fs');
var express = require('express');
var http = require('http');
var http2 = require('./node_modules/http2'); // Important: require the http2 module instead of NodeJS's internal http2 module

// Create Express Application
var app = express();

// Make HTTP2 work with Express (this must be before any other middleware)
require('express-http2-workaround')({ express:express, http2:http2, app:app });

// Setup HTTP/1.x Server
var httpServer = http.Server(app);
httpServer.listen(80,function(){
  console.log("Express HTTP/1 server started");
});

// Setup HTTP/2 Server
var httpsOptions = {
    'key' : fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/ssl.key'),
    'cert' : fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/ssl.crt'),
    'ca' : fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/ssl.crt')
};
var http2Server = http2.createServer(httpsOptions,app);
http2Server.listen(443,function(){
  console.log("Express HTTP/2 server started");
});

// Serve some content
app.get('/', function(req,res){
    res.send('Hello World! Via HTTP '+req.httpVersion);
});
```

## Advanced Use

The middleware returned by `require('express-http2-workaround')({ express:express, http2:http2 })` is a function usable by express. It's a wrapper which calls the internal `middleware` method below. It also has the `.instance` property set to the instance object which have the following properties and methods:

`requestHTTP2` - The new express request object which has [[Prototype]] set to `http2.IncomingMessage.prototype`. This object is unique per instance.

`responseHTTP2` - The new express request object which has [[Prototype]] set to `http2.ServerResponse.prototype`. This object is unique per instance.

`middleware` - The internal middleware function which checks if the request is HTTP2, then calls `setRequestAsHTTP2` and `setResponseAsHTTP2`.

`setRequestAsHTTP2` - The function which sets the request object [[Prototype]] to `requestHTTP2`, it also locks it via Object.defineProperty to prevent sub express applications overwriting it.

`setResponseAsHTTP2` - The function which sets the response object [[Prototype]] to `responseHTTP2`, it also locks it via Object.defineProperty to prevent sub express applications overwriting it.

For example, to overwrite a property or method, redefine it on `.instance`:
```javascript
var expressHTTP2WorkaroundMiddleware = require('express-http2-workaround')({ express:express, http2:http2 });
expressApp.use(expressHTTP2WorkaroundMiddleware);

// Log to console each time the middleware is called
var boundMiddleware = expressHTTP2WorkaroundMiddleware.instance.middleware.bind(expressHTTP2WorkaroundMiddleware.instance);
expressHTTP2WorkaroundMiddleware.instance.middleware = function(req, res, next){
	console.log('Hello World!');
    boundMiddleware(req, res, next);
};
```

The [[Prototype]] of the middleware is also set to the instance object, but please use `.instance` instead.
